# Getting Started
Clone this repo, and download the dependencies (SDL2, SDL2_img, and SLD2_ttf).
To compile, the project expects the dependencies to be in C:/Git/3rdParty/, but you can change this. You may also need to change the expected version for each dependency.
Clone the template project from https://github.com/NotHosomi/ASGF_Template and you can begin! The template project expects ASGF to be in C:/Git/ASGF/
